# Description 

This folder contains additional files for Convector article. Description of each file follows.

## Additional file 1.pdf

Detailed Convector algorithms description with pseudocode.

The file contains details on counting of coverages procedure, illustration of non-uniformity of coverages across samples sequenced within one experiment, explanation of assumption of CNVs absence in the dataset where we did not make direct check with alternative methods, description of potential source of false positive results, description of comparison with cn.mops and ONCOCNV. Also CNV verification procedure is described here and pseudocode of the first algorithm provided in the end.

## Additional file 2.xlsx

Target regions for panels used for Convector evalation.

xlsx file with bed files, containing: target’s chromosome, start coordinate, end coordinate, id of target, target’s region (exonic or intronic).

## Additional file 3

Description of the datasets used for Convector evaluation.

xlsx file with description of experiments: panel used for sequencing, internal id of experiment, number of samples within the experiment, laboratory where sequencing was performed, Average Robust Variance (absulte measure of noise, described in CONVector’s documentation), number of detected CNVs.

## Additional file 4

Results of Convector comparison with IonReporter and ONCOCNV.

xlsx file with data about samples: panel used for sequencing, id of experiment, internal sample’s code, laboratory, name of CNV, results of three methods. Status field denotes if particular variant was confirmed before analysis or was found by CONVector and validated.

## Additional file 5
